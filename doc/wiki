### callbacks

Q: When before_create is called?

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html

http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Callbacks/before_create

    before_create() public
    Is called before Base.save on new objects that haven’t been saved yet (no record exists).

http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Callbacks/before_save

    before_save() public
    Is called before Base.save (regardless of whether it’s a create or update save).
