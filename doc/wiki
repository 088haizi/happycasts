### screencasts spec

have a  ubuntu gnome-terminal profile named "happycasts", use "black on white", "font: monospace 17", set this profile as defualt.

then have a command "gohappycasts"

    gnome-terminal --full-screen --hide-menubar

fullscreen the vm, that will make my later work in screenflow to make the video 1024x768, a lot easier.

Turn keycastr background color to "Teal"(looks like the blackboard), it is more comfortable to look, and clearer.
