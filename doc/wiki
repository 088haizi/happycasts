### callbacks

Q: When before_create is called?

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html

http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Callbacks/before_create

    before_create() public
    Is called before Base.save on new objects that haven’t been saved yet (no record exists).

http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Callbacks/before_save

    before_save() public
    Is called before Base.save (regardless of whether it’s a create or update save).

### cancan

first thing I messed up is I wrote

   can? :read, @episode

when I shall have

    can? :read, episode




### screencasts spec

have a  ubuntu gnome-terminal profile named "happycasts", use "black on white", "font: monospace 17", set this profile as defualt.

then have a command "gohappycasts"

    gnome-terminal --full-screen --hide-menubar

fullscreen the vm, that will make my later work in screenflow to make the video 1024x768, a lot easier.

Turn keycastr background color to "Teal"(looks like the blackboard), it is more comfortable to look, and clearer.

make it 10 mins, try to show people as much as I can, lead them step by step towards getting the job done.
10 mins means the audience's time is cherished, and 10mins means not too much works for myself, so limit does bring goodies.
